AI-Refactored Mod for Escape from Tarkov

**AI-Refactored** is a comprehensive client-side AI overhaul mod for Escape from Tarkov (EFT), aimed at drastically enhancing AI behavior realism, responsiveness, and performance. It replaces EFT's default AI logic with improved and optimized decision-making, movement, combat tactics, and perception systems, making bots as indistinguishable from real human players as possible.

---

## Overview

AI-Refactored significantly upgrades Escape from Tarkov's AI system by introducing human-like behaviors, realistic sensory perception, and optimized tactical decision-making. The mod ensures smoother gameplay by eliminating robotic, unrealistic bot behavior and performance stutters associated with vanilla EFT AI.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Movement**:  
  Bots exhibit fluid and lifelike movements, including natural inertia, realistic peeking, corner scanning, smooth navigation, and tactical repositioning.

- **Enhanced Combat Tactics**:  
  Bots dynamically choose realistic fire modes, utilize cover effectively, perform suppression fire, retreat when overwhelmed, and engage intelligently based on situational awareness and personality traits.

- **Advanced Perception System**:  
  Realistic vision and hearing simulations ensure bots respond accurately to visual and auditory stimuli. Bots react authentically to darkness, sudden bright lights (e.g., flashlights), and sound sources.

- **Dynamic Squad Behavior**:  
  Bots coordinate in teams, share enemy information, perform realistic group maneuvers, and maintain squad cohesion in combat situations.

- **Personality-Based Decisions**:  
  Bots have unique personalities influencing their aggression, caution, reaction speed, looting habits, and tactical choices, resulting in varied and unpredictable interactions.

- **Optimized Performance**:  
  Thoroughly optimized to provide consistent performance, reduce CPU overhead, and eliminate stutters and gameplay interruptions typical with EFT's original AI.

## AI/LLM Note
All of my work is assisted by advanced LLMs. This saves me dev time. My mods are not entirely written by LLM, but I instead leverage them as a tool to enable me to save time on refactoring, code writing, etc. I still spend a lot of my own personal time (unpaid) developing, and learning EFT's internal logic. I use the LLMs like carpenter would use power tools in order to build and create.
If this is something that bothers, please do not feel like you need to use my mods or support me.

Thank you,
Spock
